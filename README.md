# Brooklyn-House-Price-Analysis
I am pleased to present the results of my analysis into the change in Brooklyn home purchase prices between 2016-2020, and further breakdown to analyze the price variations in Q3 2020 and Q4 2020. This analysis scope is limited to the single family occupied residences and one-unit condos/apartments.
